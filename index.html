    <h2>Alfa Romeo</h2>
<img class="leftimg" src="images/alfa.png" alt="Forza Horizon 4 Alfa Romeo Giulia">
<p>This was the first good image i took in Forza. Still my favourite one. I did try to recreate it with different photo setings... let's just say it didn't look great.. Bonus points to anyone who can guess what city this was taken in, if i haven't already told you, i'll give you a hint. It's in England and starts with an E. At this point idk what to right, this sentence has no purpose for anyone, it's just here to make the images not look weird. So.... how is life?</p>
    <h2>Porsche 911</h2>
<img class="rightimg" src="images/Porsche.png" alt="Porsche">
<p>This 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS is not as good looking as the car above. That car wins. Shortly after i took this image i decided to stop driving on the wrong side of the and, instead steer to the left and drive it off the bridge. I should do that again one day... uhhhhhhh the clouds look real.. why are you even bothering to read this sentence, it's the same as the paragraph above.. just a wast of time...</p>
