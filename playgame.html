      <p>I GOT A GAME!!!! You simply drive a buggy car around a buggy and very slow map... With no way to exit..</p>
      <p>Any antivirus you have might warn you about the file not being safe. NOTE: it is fine and won't put virus on computer... i hope... i didn't program it to do so...</p>
      <p>Also keep in mind this is only for computer. If you download it on a mobile device it will not work. I do have a mobile version but it is very unplayble... the car takes 2 minutes to just start moving forward and lags out the entire phone... i will find a away to fix it... Maybe... it took forever just to get it on the phone. It's also only for android 'cause iPhone sucks and you can't download a game from the internet. This is why us IT people despise it... well... most of us..</p>
